!!! min_fitness might me copletely different than in paper, due to oracle.
Fitnes values are reported as "fitness ((fitness - min_fitness) / max_fitness)".
avg_sequence is a sequence where each symbol is determined as the modus among training sequences.



GFP:
- max fitness = 4.123 (1.0)
- wt fitness =

avg_sequence from all variants has fitness 3.722 (0.591)
avg_sequence from 540 lowest fitness variants (<= 1.3) has fitness 3.722 (0.591)
avg_sequence from 384 lowest fitness variants has fitness 3.722 (0.591)
avg_sequence from 5 lowest fitness variants (<= 1.29) has fitness 3.722 (0.591)
avg_sequence from 3 lowest fitness variants (<= 1.29)[1:3] has fitness 3.782 (0.606)
avg_sequence from 2 lowest fitness variants (<= 1.29)[1:2] has fitness 1.289 (0.001)

    Most common single mutant at each position:
train = 384 sequences sampled from medium difficulty percentile
result = 237 sequences (10x avg_sequence, 227 single mutants at different positions)
- MEDIUM:
median fitness = 3.630 (0.569)
diversity (median paiwrise distance) = 2.0
mean pairwise distance = 1.874
- HARD:
median fitness = 3.636 (0.571)
diversity (median paiwrise distance) = 2.0
mean pairwise distance = 1.908


    Most common single mutants:
train = 384 sequences sampled from medium difficulty percentile
result = 128 sequences
- MEDIUM:
median fitness = 3.578 (0.557)
diversity (median paiwrise distance) = 2.0
mean pairwise distance = 1.981
- HARD:
median fitness = 3.573 (0.555)
diversity (median paiwrise distance) = 2.0
mean pairwise distance = 1.981


AAV:
- max fitness = 19.536 (1.0)

avg_sequence from 3 lowest fitness variants (<= 0.0)[1:3] has fitness 9.082 (0.465)
