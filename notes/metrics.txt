notation:
G* ... set of K optimized sequences
D* ... whole existing dataset
D ... train dataset (sampled from D)
distance ... number of mutations between two sequences

(1) Median of the evaluated fitness of K = 128 generated sequences.

(2) Diversity = median of the distances between every pair of sequences in generated sequences.

(3) d_init = median of the minimum distance from each sequence in D to the top 10% fitness sequences of D*.

(4) d_high = median of the minimum distance from each sequence in G* to the top 10% fitness sequences of D*.
