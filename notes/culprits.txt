- train on sampled variants from variants with fitnes under a certain percentile
- want generate K sequences with high fitness (-), and desirably, high diversity (+)
- start with 128 sequences in D + 256 N_oracle_calls
- K = 128 (+), Div. = 3.0 (on tasks: AAV medium, AAV hard, GFP medium, GFP hard)

notation:
G* ... set of K optimized sequences
D* ... whole existing dataset
D ... train dataset (sampled from D)
distance ... number of mutations between two sequences

metrics:
- We use four evaluation metrics: fitness, diversity, distance from the set of initial sequences
    (dinit), and high fitness sequences (dhigh).
- Fitness is defined as the median of the evaluated fitness of K = 128 generated sequences.
- Diversity is defined as the median of the distances between every
    pair of sequences in G*.
- The variables d_init and d_high are defined as the median of the minimum
    distance from each sequence in G* to D and to the top 10% fitness sequences of D*, respectively.

datasets:
GFP, AAV
