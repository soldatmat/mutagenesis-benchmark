___ FLIP ___
!!! - check evaluation of predictions -> many missing variants chosen, seems unlikely

- why does FLIP cnn produce nan during training on PhoQ?
    -> `hard` and `medium` tasks produce training sets with 0.0 fitness variants only
    -> solved with non-zero fitness datasets

___ DATA INSIGHTS ___
- TrpB: try to find de-normalized fitness values
    -> original paper normalizes the fitness, original probably unavailable

- PhoQ: both medium and hard task produce train sets with 0.0 fitness variants only
    -> these trian sets provide no information for training
