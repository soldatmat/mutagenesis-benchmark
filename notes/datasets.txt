GFP
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17995
length 237
size 51,715
- avg 3.7 mutations (per *gene* sequence)

- random mutagenesis
-   56,086 unique nucleotide sequences coding for
    51,715 different protein sequences
- most assayed genotypes contained several, up to 15, missense mutations



AAV
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00793-4
length 28 (segment)
size 42,330
- mutating a 28-amino-acid segment
    - all single aa substitutions
        (and additions - ?? not present in ground_truth.csv, all sequences have length 28 = length of the mutated region)
___ AAV notes ___
(C1) Complete set of single mutants
(R) Random sequence set
- 2-6 mutations: 1,732–1,756 sequences each
- 7-10 mutations: 288–290 sequences each
        9,885 total unique sequences (2-10 mutations)
- (R2) two random mutations, "possible double mutants"
- (R10) 2 to 10 random mutations
(A39) Aditive model sequence set
-  18,155 unique sequences
- sampled from single-mutant data with and additive model with Monte Carlo methods
=> ML training datasets: C1 + R2, C1 + R10, R10 + A39
___



TEM
https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msu081
length 286(+1)
size 5,199

- all single amino acid substitutions in the protein



E4B
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1303309110
length 102
size 98,289 (E4B paper) (91,032 according to table 1 in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/05/02/2023.11.28.568945.full.pdf)
- protein variants with two nucleotide mutations per variant on average
932 variants with one amino acid mutation
54,507 with two mutations
42,850 with three or more mutations



AMIE
https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15695
length 341
size 6,417 (original paper says 6820 * 0.963)
- >96.3% single mutation variants



LGK
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00131
length 439
size 7,633 (original paper says 8,056)
- single mutation variants



Pab1
https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/11/1537
length 75
size 36,389 (table) - probably considers one of three libraries only, length would be 25 then
size 110,745 (paper)
    including 1246 single amino acid substitutions (∼83% of all possible ones in each library)
    including 39,912 double amino acid substitutions (∼11% of all possible ones in each library)
    and many other variants with three or more mutations.
- three libraries
- Each library spanned 75 bases (i.e., 25 amino acids) in RRM2, with an average of three mutations per variant.



UBE2I
https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20177908
length 159
size 6,553 (paper)
size 3,022 (table ? maybe consideres single amino acid changes only + wild-type)
- 6,553 UBE2I variants, covering different combinations of 1,848 (61% of all possible) unique amino acid changes
- same paper has five other proteins
