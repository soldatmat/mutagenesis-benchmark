(1) The problem is not present if:
    (A) WT is considered as baseline (should always be identified)
    (B) WT is in initial dataset (follows the practical use case)

    (C) a combinatorial dataset with (almost) full coverage on smaller number of mutation positions is used
        - ++ provides better oracle since most variants in the limited mutational space are measured
        - -- developed methods applicable only when small number of influental positions is pre-defined
                (methods usually abuse that computations can be performed over all variants)
        - datasets: GB1 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/16965), PhoQ (https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1257360)


(2) The benchmark is not completely non-informative when methods identify variants with fitness higher than the WT.
    The interpretation of the results should just be different:
    "WT fitness -> final fitness improvement" instead of "starting fitness -> final fitness improvement"


(3) WT should already be present in the training set (information about WT is contained within the training data either way).
    Not including WT in training set adds unnecessary step (1) to the task:
        (1) Infer the WT sequence (trivial with msa)
        (2) Mutagenesis from WT
    Addition of step (1) is misleading in terms of interpretation of the achieved fitness improvement.


(4) Prediction-model oracle can be wrong.
        Especially on variants with more mutations than in the dataset or with no similiar variants in the dataset.
        Some papers make conclusion based on oracle-based fitness values wildly outside of the range in the original dataset,
        which is speculative imo.
